## Hi there 👋

I'm a data analyst with a passion for uncovering hidden insights, making hockey smarter, and turning raw data into real impact.



## 🏒 Featured Project

### [🔗 NHL Value Forwards: Identifying Underpaid Players](https://github.com/LysisVerum/nhl-underpaid-players)

> In this project, I analyzed NHL salary and performance data to find forwards who deliver elite impact for low cap hits — ideal trade or free agency targets.  
> I combined Points/$1M and xGF%/$1M into a custom Value Score and validated the approach by showing xGF% correlates strongly with team win% (R² = 0.53).  
> ✅ Complete with visualizations, code, and reproducible methods.
